### Revenue Metrics

**Revenue Metrics - Revenue Indicators**

- **Project Goal:** Create a dashboard for analyzing financial inflows in the project. This will enable product managers to track revenue changes and conduct a high-level analysis of the factors influencing these changes.
- **Functionality:** Visualization of financial inflows, high-level factor analysis, interactive parameter adjustments for deeper insights.
- **Technology Stack:** PostgreSQL and Tableau.

### Metrics Calculation and Data Preparation for Tableau Visualization

- The SQL query result was exported as a CSV file and connected to Tableau.
- Graphs and a dashboard were created.
- The dashboard includes filters for date, user language, and user age.

### Revenue Analysis

**Total Revenue:** The total amount of revenue a company generates over a given period, including all income sources such as sales and subscriptions.

### Revenue and Paid Users Analysis

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Represents the total revenue from paying users over a month, including recurring subscription payments. This is a crucial metric for revenue analysis and forecasting, as well as assessing business model stability and profitability.

**Paid Users:** Displays the number of unique users who made payments for a product or service within a month. This metric helps evaluate the effectiveness of monetization strategies, user retention, and business growth.

Together, these metrics provide insights into business revenue stability and user engagement with paid services.

### Analysis of New Paying Users and Their Contribution to Monthly Revenue

**New MRR:** This metric shows the amount of recurring revenue generated by new paying users during a given month. It reflects the growth of new customers and their contribution to the company's overall revenue.

**New Paid Users:** This metric indicates the number of users who started paying for a product or service for the first time within a given period. It highlights the effectiveness of the company’s user acquisition strategies.

These metrics help measure the efficiency of acquiring and retaining new paying users and their impact on total revenue.

---

### Churned Revenue and User Loss Analysis

**Churned Revenue:** The total amount of revenue lost due to customer churn over a specific period. This includes all revenue lost from users who canceled their paid subscriptions or stopped using paid services.

**Churned Users:** The number of users who stopped using the company’s paid services or products over a given period.

These metrics help measure revenue and user losses, which can be useful for evaluating retention strategies and reducing churn.

---

### Monthly Revenue Growth and Decline Analysis

**Expansion MRR:** This metric measures changes in monthly revenue (MRR) from existing customers due to subscription upgrades, increased spending, or additional purchases.

**Contraction MRR:** Measures changes in MRR due to subscription downgrades, reduced spending, or canceled payments.

These metrics help evaluate internal revenue changes among existing customers, identifying patterns in user behavior such as upgrades or downgrades.

---

### Customer Lifetime and Lifetime Value Analysis

**Avg. LT:** The average number of days a user remains a customer each month.

**LTV (Customer Lifetime Value):** Represents the total revenue generated from a user throughout their lifetime as a customer. It may vary depending on changes in spending levels and user profitability.

![](https://github.com/Valentyna-Lychko/Data-Analytics-Projects-UA-/raw/main/Dashboards_PNG/LT_LTV.png)

An increase in average lifetime may indicate improved customer retention, while a rising LTV suggests successful monetization strategies or increased average spending.

---

### ARPPU and Paid Users Analysis

**ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paid User):** The average revenue generated per paying user over a given period. Calculated as ARPPU = Revenue / Paid Users.

**Paid Users:** The number of users who paid for a product or service within a given period.

Analyzing ARPPU and paid user numbers helps assess monetization effectiveness, identify key user segments, and optimize revenue strategies.
