### Tableau: My Projects

This section showcases several dashboards created in Tableau. All projects focus on analyzing various metrics, including revenue, user count, user behavior, and other key indicators. The following approaches and tools were used:

1. **Calculated Fields:** Used to create metrics that provide analytical depth to the dashboards.  
2. **Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions:** Applied to analyze data at different levels of granularity.  
3. **Parameters:** Implemented for dynamic data control and flexible visualization adjustments.  
4. **Filters and Filter Actions:** Interactive filters enabled data segmentation and customized views for analytical needs.  
5. **Conditional Expressions:** Used to enhance dashboards through logical calculations and conditional formatting.  

Various types of charts were used in the projects, including:
- **Bar Chart**  
- **Line Chart**  
- **Pie Chart**  
- **Heat Map**  
- **Bubble Chart**  
- **Area Chart**  
- **Tree Map**  
- **Scatter Plot**  
- **Dual-Axis Chart**
